# Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of algorithms designed to solve programming problems in the most efficient and optimal manner. Primarily focused on LeetCode solutions, it encompasses a wide array of problems ranging from basic data structures to advanced algorithmic paradigms. Drawing from software engineering principles, the implementations emphasize scalability, maintainability, and performanceâ€”key tenets in system design, backend development, and AI applications.

In system design, these algorithms underpin efficient backend services, such as optimizing query processing in distributed systems or enhancing API response times through memoization and caching strategies. For backend engineers, the code highlights best practices in handling large-scale data with minimal computational overhead. In the realm of AI, many solutions align with core techniques like dynamic programming for reinforcement learning, graph algorithms for neural network traversals, and search optimizations for pathfinding in machine learning models.
